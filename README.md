#We are making a mobile friendly UI as per instruction and given xd link.
#We are making 2 pages design from xd and another pages as per needs.

#What is in the application?: This is a demo application. That will help to manage users weekly expenses and list the all last 7 days expenses. User can also manage his weekly limit from spending limit page. 

1. Debit Card page: there is only one functionality dynamic which is progress bar. Progress bar show a weekly total limit and expense in green color so use know how much limit is remain and how much is used.

2. Weekly spend limit page: 
=> User can set the limit for one week and after a week expense and limit automatically reset and user can set new limit from next week. When ever user can add a new limit expense and old limit will be reset and count next 7 days as new coming week. 
=> Below of input box there is some recommendation for adding amount so user don't need to type and easily can add limit only using one click.

3. Home (Expense) page: User can see last 7 days expanse in the list with date, title, description, and amount. as of now we are not providing delete and edit functionality but we can do it as well. 

4. Add expense: User can add expense from this page. There is title, description and amount. 

5. We write a some test case of application.

Capability: In the application we used reduxt thunk but we also know the redux saga and in past we worked with redux saga.
